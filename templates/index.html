                    <p>
                        Code Golf is a new type of competition that ProgSoc is releasing into the wild.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each fortnight there will be a new industry focused computer science / engineering question for
                        you to answer. The person who provides the best solution will win that week's prize, and puts you
                        in the running for the major prize at the end of the year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You only have to complete the questions that you want to complete, and there is no punishment for
                        not finishing a question so its a low stress, low maintenance way to challenge yourself and maybe
                        learn new things about computers and software along the way.

                        We're a bunch of students and alumni who love to keep ourselves busy throughout the year by
                        having as many projects, contests, gatherings and drink ups as we can, and have been doing so for
                        over 25 years now.

                    <p>
                        We're hosting code golf as a way to get more coupling between the student body and the industry.
                        It's no secret that just doing your degree without ever writing a line of code outside of your
                        assignments won't teach you very much, and we want to help fill that void.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Plus, it's fun!</strong>
                        We love setting challenges to be solved by our members and we love even more giving them prizes
                        and rewards for solving them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There is <em>ALOT</em> in it for the students. Not only do you better yourself as a developer,
                        you also get involved with software companies before you've even left uni.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine leaving university, and as your potential first employer asks what makes you different,
                        you can show them your profile, packed with badges and submissions to challenging and real
                        problems.

                    <p>
                        One more thing... <strong>The prizes!</strong> Each week has a new prize gratiously donated by a
                        sponsor. And with each question you answer your name goes in the draw for the prize at the end of
                        the year, the more questions you answer the better your chances are.
